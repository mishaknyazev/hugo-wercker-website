abstract = "PWeak grammatical violations, i.e. violations that result in intermediate unacceptability, pose challenges for a formal description of grammar since it remains undecided whether they are the result of a true grammatical constraint or merely an epiphenomenal consequence of processing complexity. Neither informal grammaticality judgements nor corpus data alone can reveal fine- grained distinctions that may be inherent in a grammatical phenomenon. In this context, experimental syntax methods, which have gained in popularity in recent years (see [Schütze, Sprouse 2013]), can be helpful in providing evidence for subtle grammatical distinctions. In this paper I illustrate this thesis with a case study from the distribution of čto-clause complements in Russian focusing on the restriction on the complements of nouns, consisting in the sensitivity to the collocational vs. non-collocational nature of the context. Employing the methodology of the investigation of island effects in (Sprouse et. al), I provide experimental evidence for the grammatical status of the restriction on čto clauses, which cannot be firmly established on the basis of introspection or usage data."

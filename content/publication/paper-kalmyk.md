abstract = "The paper examines syntactic and distributional properties of complementizers in Kalmyk, morphologically identical to non-finite forms of the verb 'say' (gi-), which is a common feature in Altaic languages. It is shown that when used as a complementizer the verb gi- still exhibits certain features associated with the verb 'say' as manifested in its distribution and restrictions on the interpretation of indexicals. At the same time, in its verbal uses the verb gi- shares a number of properties pertaining to functional elements. A unified analysis of both complementizer and verbal uses is proposed where gi- is a functional verb with impoverished semantic content."
